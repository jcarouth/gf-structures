# Gravity Forms Structures

This library provides a set of classes that can be used to facilitate development of add-ons for Gravity Forms.
It intends to provide an interface for configuring array-based entities, with the goal of making the requirements
and options of a given entity more evident to newer developers seeking to build add-ons for Gravity Forms.

## Releases/Versioning
The `main` branch of this repo will always be considered "release-ready", but will not itself be a release.
Stable releases will be tagged in accordance with [semver](https://semver.org) standards.

The `develop` branch of this repo will be treated as a trunk and should not be considered stable. When trying
out this library, I recommend checking out the main branch of a tagged, stable release.

## Installation
Coming soon!
